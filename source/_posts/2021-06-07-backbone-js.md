## Underscore.js

It's just a javascript library of which offer useful function to treat arrays, or collections.

## Backbone.Model

It's to express the data. It could be used only itself without Collection. If this model elements is changed then UI will be changed automatically.

## Backbone.View

the advantage of Backbone.View instance is the data used at there and the ui would be changed automatically.

MVC means Model, View, Collection

C is not Controller. haha
